        <p>James Kozak's art portfolio is colorful, creative, and bold.  It reflects the vibrancy of his hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
        <p>Art mediums include oil, acrylic, pastel and sculpture.  His artwork works at capturing the unique ethnicity of Pittsburgh's neighborhoods and it's beautiful, enveloping hills, rivers, and architecture. </p>
        <p>The city's deep roots in the coal and steel industry along with it's transformation into a global technology center, provide for a rich pallete. </p>
